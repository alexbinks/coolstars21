	 <h3 align="left">A complete volume-limited census of the Solar Neighbourhood for stars and brown-dwarfs all the way down to the D-burning limit is
	    an astronomical Rosetta stone. Nearby examples across the entire mass spectrum serve as benchmarks for testing fundamental laws
	    that apply across the Milky Way and provide unparalleled conditions for high-resolution imaging, the results from which are
	    critical for constraining evolutionary models at any epoch. Since their discovery almost 30 years ago, brown-dwarfs are now being
	    unveiled in their thousands and by filling the lowest-end of the mass function in the Solar Neighbourhood, astronomers can predict
	    how many stars, brown dwarfs or planets reside over a wide range of environments, leading to significant gains in our understanding
	    of Galactic ecology at all scales.
         </h3>
         <h3 align="left">
            For our nearest neighbours, Gaia has been a formidable tool in finding (very) low-mass objects, giving us parallaxes (and optical
            photometry) for all stars within ~80pc down to the substellar boundary (0.072 Mʘ). However, further down at the D-burning limit
	    (~0.013 Mʘ) brown-dwarfs are so optically faint that they evade even Gaia’s glare! Given their extremely low temperatures, the best
	    way to capture these is with (mid/far) infrared (IR) surveys. Previous missions such as Spitzer and WISE have filled a huge gap for
	    L- and T-dwarfs and continue to remain at the forefront of campaigns to characterise brown-dwarfs. These have even led to the recent
	    introduction of a new spectral class, the Y-dwarfs, whose surface temperatures are <400K.
         </h3>
         <h3 align="left">
	    The coldest brown-dwarfs can only be observed very near the Sun, which would limit a complete census to the nearest few pc, resulting
	    in only a handful of the extremely low-mass objects available for study. However, young brown dwarfs are hotter and considerably more
	    luminous than their older counterparts, meaning the distance horizon for observing brown-dwarfs extends dramatically at younger ages.
	    Fortunately, within 150pc there exist at least a dozen gravitationally unbound co-moving, coeval associations of young stars, whose
	    member sizes range from tens to several hundreds, and are dubbed as “moving groups” (MGs). These MGs represent the vast majority of
	    the nearest known young stars (ages 10-150 Myr), and Gaia has helped unveil a large fraction of the elusive low-mass MG members, whose
	    youth and proximity render them prime pickings for high-resolution imaging – and represent crucial testbeds to probe our understanding
	    of brown-dwarfs. Re-evaluating the census of Solar neighbours, particularly those at younger ages, could lead to definitive
	    understandings of the initial mass function of stars into brown dwarfs. At the same time, Gaia has revealed entirely new kinematic
	    ensembles and a population of seemingly young but “homeless” stars that may have once resided in distant star-forming regions. The
	    study of these objects is pointing us towards the origins of the young Solar neighbourhood, and may offer clues about the birthplace of
	    the Sun.
         </h3>
         <h3 align="left">
	    Generally, Gaia facilitates two types of “candidate” MG member searches. The first are chosen based on having proper-motions consistent
	    with a given MG (kinematically-biased), and the second based on some broad indicator of youth (kinematically-unbiased), where it remains
	    a challenge to estimate accurate absolute ages for MGs, which are vital to correctly infer masses and mass-dependent parameters. The
	    former yields higher hit-rates for new members, but the latter can identify new groups. Whatever the search mechanism, radial velocity
	    (RV) measurements are needed to verify membership, and are often lacking (particularly for low-mass stars). By the time Cool Stars 21
	    takes place, Gaia should have provided a new haul: a quadrupling of Gaia RV measurements! This will produce the most complete 6D
	    spatio-kinematic map of the Solar neighbourhood to date, and will undoubtedly give us an even more detailed snapshot and history of the
	    Solar neighbourhood, helping us calibrate evolutionary models so as to improve inferred astrophysical properties across the mass spectrum,
	    but also the complex nature of multiple stellar systems, clusters and the mechanisms that eventually dissolve clusters and disperse their
            components into the lonely Galactic field.
         </h3>
         <h3 align="left">
	    A non-trivial connection between age, activity and rotation has been seen in pre-main sequence stars and brown-dwarfs for over 50 years.
	    The exact details of this tripartite relationship remain elusive and absolute ages for young clusters are still at odds. Despite this,
	    surveys dedicated to probing for chromospheric (GALEX, IPHAS) and coronal (Chandra, eROSITA) activity show young stars are often flaring
	    and highly variable, and satellite-based time-series photometric surveys (e.g., TESS, Kepler) are providing hordes of rotation periods,
	    often with signs of surface inhomogeneities indicative of high photospheric activity. Additionally a full census of nearby stars and brown
	    dwarfs in MGs helps quantify multiplicity (known to be high in brown-dwarfs).
